Then calculate the total utility for each vendor weighted by the weights you assigned. Sort the shortlisted vendors based on the total utility score in descending order. Return vendors from best to worst. The return format should start with the 5 top vendors, along with their scores. Make sure to separately include the remaining vendors with their scores, along with the reasoning for how you chose the weights and the formula you used to calculate utility."
